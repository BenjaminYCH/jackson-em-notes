# Classical Electrodynamics 3rd Edition By J.D Jackson, Solutions, Notes and Visualization programs

I started to tackle this infamous book, as a hobby.

This repository is a collection of my effort to fill *every* missing derivation gap in the main text, write the solution for every (non-trivial) problems I can solve, and along the way, write code to render a lot of cool visualizations (animations).

## Content

* `pdf`: Notes on the text, and solutions to the problems.
* `go`: misc go code for field potential/line renderings, and various other computations
* `octave`: misc octave code for graphs, etc
* `python`: misc python code for computations.
